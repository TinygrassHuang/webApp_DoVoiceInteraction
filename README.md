## Description
This project originally aims to achieve multi-speaker speech recognition for the Data Observatory Voice Bot developed at Imperial College London. When multiple people talk to the voice bot, the voice bot is able to distinguish between different users and give different response.

We build a website that can characterise (distinguish) different users voices. Users can record or upload their voices on the website. Our trained model will analyse and label the audio file in the files page. As the use upload audio files from different users, the audio files will be labeled with different user number. The user number given should be unique for different speakers. The first speaker ever uploaded is set to User 1, as more speakers are uploaded, they are labeled as User 2 and so on.
